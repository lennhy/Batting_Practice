#Eagerto Batting Practice

##Introduction
This repo contains some HTML, CSS, and JS files that constitute a simple but partially functioning application. Also included in the repo are some mockups and design instructions that explain how the app should function and look across multiple viewport sizes. One of your tasks is to use those designs to finish implementing the app. You'll notice that we did not provide mock-ups for all viewport sizes and orientations. However, you still should implement styles so the app is responsive and looks good across other sizes and orientations. In other words, it's up to you to decide how the app should look on mobile-landscape and tablet-portrait devices. You may import any libraries/frameworks that you think are necessary.
